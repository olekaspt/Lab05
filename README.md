# Lab05
The objective of this Lab is to explore solutions using recursion/stacks, Exceptions, and Templates

Must follow standards cited here:
https://github.com/olekaspt/LabStandards/blob/main/README.md

## Task 1 Explore relationship between recursion/Stacks

Implement two functions to calculate a factorial of integer number, one using recursion and the other using a stack.


## Task 2 Using the recursive implementation of Queensolver, switch it to use a stack.

Using the recursive starter implementation for Queensolver.  Switch it to use a stack.

You will need to provide screen shots of just one valid solution of a queen placed on a 8X8 board.  You MUST use a stack (you can use any STL container and use it like a stack).  This will go into your Lab report.

You can stop after getting a single valid solution.


## Task 3 Exceptions

  * Implement CallSimpleException to return a string of the status of the call to make the unit tests pass.
  * Additionally using  try\catch blocks catch the exceptions to report the error string correct
  * Free the memory of the MyFakeClass appropriately.
  * Add in MyException3

## Task 4 Modify the code from for the Stack and Queue Lab to use Templates

You can choose your implementation or the starter code if you have troubles with Lab02.

Recall you will need to not complile the StackQueue.cpp (so just take out the Shared object from CMakeLists.txt).

Your goal is for the stack and queue code to compile as well the testcase code. This will mean you will need to modify them.  It is not a requirement of them to pass, since I'm allowing to you use the starter code (which will not pass) or your completed lab.

## Task 5 Participation Matrix

Participation rubric of teammates.  List out for your all team members how much they participated.  This will go into your Lab report.
```
	             Member1	Member2	Member3
Member1 (opinion)	33	     33	     33
Member2 (opinion)	33	     33	     33
Member3 (opinion)	33	     33	     33
```			
			
Example 			
```
	             Member1	Member2	Member3
Member1 (opinion)	33	     33	     33
Member2 (opinion)	20	     40	     40
Member3 (opinion)	20	     40	     40
```

## Lab Submission:
* lab report pdf of requested data from tasks above.
* All code into a tar file


## Lab Grading:
1.	20% - Task 1 has been correctly implemented and meets all requirements 
1.	20% - Task 2 has been correctly implemented and meets all requirements 
1.	20% - Task 3 has been correctly implemented and meets all requirements.
1.	20% - Task 4 has been correctly implemented and meets all requirements.
1.	20% - Task 5, Code style, Participation Rubric, and Information requested in PDF
If program fails to compile, 0% will be given for that Task.
